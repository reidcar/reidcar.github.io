      <p class="text-muted">
        I chose this artifact because I am frequently facing the challenge of AI and technology replacing my creativity within my photography field. 
        I was initially very upset when AI features began appearing in Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, as they let people create whatever they want 
        without needing much, if any, technical skill. As someone who has been honing these skills for a decade, it feel's disheartening.

        This camera is not something that exists yet, but I can imagine it becoming a reality, or at least some similar technology. 
        This design is a camera run by AI, where photography becomes guided by an algorithm trained on visual perfection, rather than the natural creative human eye. 
        The camera itself can optimize lighting, framing, and other factors. However, in doing so, it erases the emotion and human intuition that makes photography art. 
        Can this camera predict an athlete's emotional celebration? Can do something against patterns and traditional perfection to make something more unique/creative? 
        Prevision vs. creativity is the main theme here; how automation reshapes tools as well as our sense of beauty and imperfection.
      <p class="text-muted">
        The zine explores how automation reshapes both our tools and our sense of beauty. Its central tension ‚Äî <strong>precision vs. creativity</strong> ‚Äî 
        asks whether a machine can ever truly capture human imperfection, spontaneity, or joy.
