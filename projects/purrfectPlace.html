            Players pick a cat-character and face short, silly moral dilemmas. It's cute, a little goofy, and hopefully makes you think without feeling like a chore.
            The Good Place felt particularly relevant to what we've been speaking about in class. I think I pull a lot of my ethical learning from this show, 
            and have always wanted to turn it into a project. I wanted to see if serious moral stuff could feel fun. Mixing cute cats with small ethics lessons makes 
            thinking about right and wrong feel… less scary?
